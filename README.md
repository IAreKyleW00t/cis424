---------------------------------
###### Professor: Dr. Jongman Kim; Fall 2016

This is a repository for all projects and assingments done in CIS 424/524.

> A short history of programming languages and coding styles precedes the study of a collection of programming paradigms. The major programming paradigms are surveyed, including procedural, functional, object-oriented, graphical-user-interface based, and logic programming. The relationships between syntax, semantics and the compilation process are investigated.
