Project 1

#### Description
  A program that will use a `dictionary` to count the number of occurrences of each word in a file that is provided from the user through the command line. It will print the number of different words and the total number of words in the file. It will then print all the words that have a length of 4 characters or more and the number of occurrences in descending order.

#### Example
  ```
